      "And a spectacular eve-of-opening concert, featuring tenor Andrea Bocelli, Chinese pianist Lang Lang and the choir and opera of the city´s renowned La Scala opera house performing in front of Milan´s magnificent Gothic cathedral, was a reminder of the country´s capacity to compensate with creativity for its shortcomings in the more humdrum aspects of event planning\n",

      "“The first and foremost, exports, the prime source of foreign exchange earnings for the country, have been stagnant in the recent past, and declined during July-March (period) of FY15,” the central bank said in its latest report covering economic performance during the third quarter (January-March 2015) of the last fiscal year that ended on June 30, 2015\n",

      "\"It´s going to be a big challenge in New Zealand, but I´m confident if we can continue playing the way we are, hopefully we can have a lot of success over there\n",
      "\"Smith´s own form hit a minor blip when he was dismissed for 10 in Australia´s only innings in the first test against West Indies but the runs were flowing again in Melbourne last week after knocks of 134 and 70 without being dismissed\n",

      "strong>SYDNEY: Big financial incentives for gamblers, small tournaments of little consequence to top players and the ease of fixing the outcome of a one-on-one sport have helped turn world tennis into a haven for match-fixers, according to experts and industry insiders\n",
      "</strongTennis was rocked on Monday by allegations that the game´s authorities have failed to deal with widespread match-fixing, just as the Australian Open, the first grand slam tournament of the year, kicked off in Melbourne\n",
      "Multiple sources told Reuters that the revelation was no surprise to those who closely follow the sport, where, out of the spotlight at small tournaments around the world, the temptations are obvious and malfeasance very difficult to prove\n",
      "Dozens of untelevised tournaments are held annually and top players often inexplicably lose to relatively unknown opponents, said Steve Georgakis, a senior lecturer at the University of Sydney, who is researching match-fixing in tennis\n",
      "\"If you have a look at the big tournaments, the Opens or Olympic Games, you´ll notice that in a lot of these tournaments the favourite usually wins,\" he said\n",
      "But at a small tournament the following week, how could anyone prove that a top 50 player didn´t lose because they were exhausted or injured, said Georgakis\n",
      "A highly ranked player is almost certain to be the odds-on favourite to win in these small tournaments and thus has the greatest opportunity to make money by intentionally losing to an outmatched player, handing a big payoff to those behind the fix\n",
      "\"It´s a one-on-one sport and what you do is, you´re the favourite and you get a few other people to load up on the other player to win and then you throw the match\n",

      "strong>WASHINGTON: Uber has grounded its fleet of self-driving cars pending an investigation into the crash of an Uber autonomous vehicle in Arizona, a spokesperson for the car-hailing service said Sunday\n",
      "</strongNo one was seriously injured in the accident which occurred Friday in Tempe, Arizona while the vehicle -- a Volvo SUV -- was in self-driving mode, the company said\n",
      "\"We are continuing to look into this incident and can confirm we had no backseat passengers in the vehicle,\" the Uber spokesperson said\n",
      "The accident occurred when the other vehicle \"failed to yield\" while making a left turn, Tempe police spokeswoman Josie Montenegros said\n",
      "\"The vehicles collided causing the autonomous vehicle to roll onto it´s side\n",
      " There were no serious injuries,\" she said\n",
      "Self-driving Uber vehicles always have a driver who can take over the controls at any time\n",
      "Montenegro said it was uncertain whether the Uber driver was controlling the vehicle at the time of the collision\n",
      "The company grounded its self-driving vehicles in Arizona after the accident, and then followed up on Saturday pulling them off the road in Pittsburg and San Francisco, the two other locations where it operates self-driving vehicles, the company said\n",
      "The car-hailing service has been dented by a series of bad news stories, including disclosures about a culture of sexism, cut-throat workplace tactics and covert use of law enforcement-evading software\n",
      "A number of executives have left the company in recent weeks, including president Jeff Jones, as troubles have mounted\n",
      "Advocates of self-driving cars say that they can cut down on deadly traffic accidents by eliminating human error\n",
      "But there have been accidents, including a fatality in Florida in May when a truck struck a speeding Tesla that was on autopilot\n",
      "An investigation found no safety-related defects with the autopilot system, but concluded that the driver may have had time to avert the crash if he had been paying closer attention\n",

      "strong>BEIJING: The New Development Bank plans to co-finance infrastructure projects with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) along the Belt and Road economies after more members join in, the NDB’s vice president said\n",
      "</strong“There will be unlimited opportunities to co-finance projects with the AIIB in the future along the Belt and Road, because we share so much in common while selecting projects,” Leslie Maasdorp told China Daily during the Boao Forum for Asia\n",
      "One year older than its peer multilateral bank AIIB, the NDB was opened in Shanghai in 2015, founded by the BRICS emerging economies, which include Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa\n",
      "“We are both interested in investing in projects that are sustainable, commercially viable and have long term economic benefits,” he said\n",
      " “Countries along the Belt and Road have huge demand for such projects, and we can work together to fill the infrastructural gap\n",
      "”Future projects can be those that would produce spillover effects to neighboring economies, similar to the latest one approved by the NDB, an offshore wind project located in Xiamen, Fujian province, according to Maasdorp\n",
      "Maasdorp said one major difference between the two banks is that the NDB now only focuses on meeting the demands of five founding members, because the capital comes from the five, while AIIB has a universal procurement policy\n",
      "But the policy might change in the future as the NDB looks at new members in the coming years, Maasdorp said\n",
      "Similar to AIIB, the bank is keeping its door open to all members in the United Nations, Maasdorp said\n",
      "Maasdorp said the bank welcomes applicants along the Belt and Road\n",
      " The ultimate membership composition would be 80 percent of developing countries and 20 percent of developed countries, as the NDB wrote in its founding documents\n",
