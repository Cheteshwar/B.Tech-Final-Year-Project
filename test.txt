RESULT REVIEW    BOB Capital Markets Ltd is a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of Baroda Important disclosures, including any required research certifications, are provided at the end of this report.  BUY TP: Rs 360  |   17% STATE BANK OF INDIA | Banking | 02 August 2019   Dismal quarter State Bank of India’s (SBIN) Q1FY20 PAT of Rs 23bn was in line with our estimate. Asset quality was a miss with the stressed book swelling to Rs 274bn (vs. Rs 77.6bn in Q4) as SBIN is resolving standard accounts worth Rs 191.4bn post RBI’s 7 June circular. Fresh slippages more than doubled QoQ to Rs 162bn, and additional provisions of Rs 23bn were made towards DHFL and a renewable energy project. Management expects DHFL resolution in Q2. We cut FY20-FY21 EPS by 8-20% and revise our Mar’20 TP to Rs 360 (vs. Rs 375).

SBIN’s stressed book (incl. SMA) swelled to Rs 274bn (vs Rs 77.6bn in Q4) as the bank is resolving standard accounts worth Rs 191.4bn, including DHFL and a renewable energy project together worth ~Rs 140bn, post RBI’s 7 June circular. Credit cost guidance is intact at 1.4% for FY20 while PCR on SBIN’s corporate book stands at 71%. Loan growth stable; NIM set to improve: Loan growth at 14% YoY was steady, underpinned by a ~12%/19% increase in corporate/retail credit. Retail loan growth was fuelled by a ~28% rise in home loans. Domestic NIM increased 6bps QoQ to 3% (FY20 guidance at 3.15%). Interest reversals stood at Rs 27.9bn as interest accrued was reversed on agriculture loan slippage in Q1. Maintain BUY: We cut FY20-FY21 EPS by 8-20% following the spike in SBIN’s stressed book, but continue to value the core business at 1.1x FY21E P/ABV.
